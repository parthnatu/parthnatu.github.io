I"»<p>I am trying to create and maintain a project portfolio with an accompanying blog. This has proven to be more difficult than I had imagined.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m about to study Computer Science at Penn State as a graduate student. Itâ€™s been a dream of mine to study CS and I canâ€™t wait. Classes begin 25th August. Woop-woop :)</li>
  <li>I spent June 2018 - 2019 as an intern. To call it a privilege would be an understatement. I worked on Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition and Robot Process Automation. All of this was in the Life Sciences domain. Learned so much.</li>
  <li>I am currently in Switzerland enjoying a much needed vacation. Itâ€™s not all play though - I am prepping myself for graduate studies. Brushing up Math and reading some books. I am also trying to make it a habit to read scientific literature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I must add, Jekyll looks fantastic as a static blog renderer.</p>
